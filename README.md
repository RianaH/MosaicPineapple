# MosaicPineapple Project: Comparing Commonly-Used Langauge Models' Efficacy for Language Proficiency Detection

This project uses a dataset of CEFR labeled English texts to train discriminative language models to be able to detect the CEFR level of a new input text. We will then use data gathered concerning the effectiveness of language models at distinguishing between CEFR levels to evaluate the effectiveness of automatic proficiency detection. Additionally, the various models will be compared directly to see if any models performed exceptionally well in certain scenarios, or with certain prompting techniques.

Dataset Source:
CEFR-SP (https://github.com/yukiar/CEFR-SP), a dataset of about 10000 publicly accessible English sentences labeled by their CEFR proficiency level, made for the following paper:
