# MosaicPineapple Project: English Proficiency Detection and Generation

This project uses a dataset of CEFR labeled English texts to train discriminative and generative language models to be able to both detect the CEFR level of a new input text and to be able to output new text of a given CEFR level. We will then use data gathered concerning the effectiveness of language models at distinguishing between closely related CEFR levels (i.e. B1 and B2) compared to further apart levels (i.e. A1 and C1) to evaluate the effectiveness of automatic proficiency detection.
